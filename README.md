We designed several tasks using [Expyriment](https://expyriment.org/), a Python library for programming experiments in cognitive science, to study the precision of temporal expectations in the subcortical and cortical auditory pathway.
## Localizer
This task can be used for localizing auditory areas during MRI scanning. Participants are presented with natural sounds interspersed with silent periods and are asked to determine whether each sound has been repeated or not.

## Detection Accuracy
This task includes sequential presentation of multiple tone sequences. The tones are randomly displaced and the participants are asked to press a key when they hear a displacement.
