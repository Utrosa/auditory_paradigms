We designed several tasks using the [Expyriment](https://expyriment.org/), a Python library for programming experiments in cognitive science, to study the precision of temporal expectations in the subcortical and cortical auditory pathway.
## Localizer
This task can be used for localizing auditory areas during MRI scanning. Participants are presented with natural sounds interspersed with silent periods and are asked to determine whether each sound has been repeated or not.
## Detection Accuracy
This task inlcudes sequential presentation of mulitiple tone sequences.
