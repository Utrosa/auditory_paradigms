# localizer
We designed a task using the Expyriment [https://expyriment.org/], a Python library for programming experiments in cognitive science. Our task can be used for localizing auditory areas during MRI scanning. Througout the experiment, participants are presented with natural sounds interspersed with silent periods and are asked to determine whether each sound has been repeated or not.
